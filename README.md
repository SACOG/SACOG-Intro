## Start Here

To help save you time, figure out what kind of user you are:
* If you just want to grab some scripts from SACOG one time and do not care about learning Git, you can just go to any repository, click the "Code" button, and select "Download ZIP" to download a ZIP file containing all files in the repository.
* Never used Git or GitHub before? Or want to brush up? Check out [Learning Git and GitHub](##Learning-Git-and-GitHub)
* If you want to contribute to SACOG's GitHub, please follow the [Contribution Guidelines](#Contribution-Guidelines)





## Learning Git and GitHub

There are many resources to learn the Git language and GitHub. Some good starting points include:
* [GitHub's Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/#repository) is a great starting point to learn to most common Git commands and about Git itself.
    - FYI, if you are not used to command line, you may want to get [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop)
    - If you're using GitHub Desktop, [check out this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop)
* [GitImmersion.com](https://gitimmersion.com/) is a great, hands-on way to learn Git on the command line
* GitHub's [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) exercise is a hands-on way to learn how to work with GitHub


### Fixing Common Git Mistakes
Did you accidentally commit something that had a lot of issues with it? Did you mean to commit something to a testing branch but accidentally committed to a main branch? Or anything else that makes you worried that you lost some good work? All is probably not lost--just refer to these resources:
* See the Medium article on [Fixing common git mistakes](https://github.com/SACOG/SACOG-Intro/blob/main/Fixing%20Common%20Git%20Mistakes.pdf)
* Check out [Oh Sh-t, Git!?!](https://ohshitgit.com/)
